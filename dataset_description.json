We thank Rüdiger Stirnberg and Tony Stöcker from DZNE in Bonn for sharing, optimizing, and supporting us with the 3D-EPI VASO sequence used here. We thank Vojtěch Smekal, Till Steinbach and Maite van der Miesen for helpful discussions on the manuscript. Special thanks goes to the remaining ‘‘Maastricht layer-seminar’’ members Lonike Faes, Lasse Knudsen and Kenshu Koiso, for countless discussions on topics related to layer-fMRI. Finally, we thank Kamil Uludag for the inspiring discussions on neurovascular coupling.",
